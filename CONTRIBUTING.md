## How to contribute to PrioritySieve

Contributions are very welcomed! Don't be afraid to ask questions or request features, I promise to always be polite ;)

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub
  under [Issues](https://github.com/mortii/prioritysieve/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abug).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the
  problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/mortii/prioritysieve/issues/new/choose). Include a title and clear
  description, and as much relevant information as possible.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub [pull request](https://github.com/mortii/prioritysieve/pulls) with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Open a ['Feature request' issue](https://github.com/mortii/prioritysieve/issues/new/choose), and ask if your proposed
  feature/change would be accepted. It _really_ sucks to spend a lot of
  time and effort on something to then have it be rejected, so make sure you don't skip this step!

* Reading the [setup docs](https://mortii.github.io/prioritysieve/developer_guide/setup.html) might be useful to you.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* [Create a new discussion](https://github.com/mortii/prioritysieve/discussions) and tag me (@mortii).

#### **Do you find the guide confusing or lacking in some way?**

* Open a ['Documentation request' issue](https://github.com/mortii/prioritysieve/issues/new/choose), and point out the
  problem, and I will try to make it better! Suggestions are **very** welcomed, I am terrible at writing guides.
* If you want to change the docs directly then see
  the [docs setup](https://mortii.github.io/prioritysieve/developer_guide/docs.html), and create
  a [pull request](https://github.com/mortii/prioritysieve/pulls) with the
  changes you made.

Thanks!
