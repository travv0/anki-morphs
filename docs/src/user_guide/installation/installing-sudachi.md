# Installing SudachiPy

Use the Sudachi Manager to download and update the SudachiPy tokenizer and dictionaries without leaving Anki.

1. In Anki, navigate to `Tools → PrioritySieve → Sudachi Manager`.
2. Click **Install SudachiPy** to install or update the core tokenizer package.
3. Select one of the available dictionaries (`small`, `core`, or `full`) and choose **Install Dictionary**.
4. Close the manager and, if prompted, restart Anki so the new packages are picked up.

You can remove SudachiPy or any downloaded dictionaries from the same dialog. Once installed, each dictionary variant appears as a separate morphemizer in the PrioritySieve **Note Filter** tab, where you can pick the desired variant and split mode for every note type you configure.
