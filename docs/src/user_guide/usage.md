# Usage

After you have finished [installing](installation.md) and [setting up](setup.md), you can run [Recalc](usage/recalc.md)
and finally start using AnkiMorphs with your cards! Delve into how to use AnkiMorphs with the following sections:

* [Reviewing cards](usage/reviewing-cards.md) with AnkiMorphs.
* Using the [Browser Options](usage/browser.md).
* [Generating priority files](usage/generators.md#frequency-file-generator) to change morph priorities.
* [Generating readability reports](usage/generators.md#readability-report-generator) to find out much of specified files you will be able to read.
* [Exporting known morphs](usage/known-morphs-exporter.md) so you can trim down your card collection.
* [Gauging your overall progress](usage/progression.md) in terms of morph priorities.
