## Pytest Add-ons

### pytest-qt

* [official docs](https://pytest-qt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html)
* [Troubleshooting](https://pytest-qt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/troubleshooting.html)

pytest-qt is a pytest plugin that allows programmers to write tests for PyQt5, PyQt6, PySide2 and PySide6 applications.

### pytest-xvfb

* [pypi docs](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-xvfb/)

With Xvfb and the plugin installed, your testsuite automatically runs with Xvfb. This allows tests to be run without
windows popping up during GUI tests or on systems without a display (like a CI).

This is necessary for tests to work on GitHub actions.
